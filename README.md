# Face-mask-Detection-Using-Arduino
During Covid-19 period wearing mask is crucial one, so I've developed a ML project which can detect multiple faces and show the result. I've even worked on Arduino which turns the camera towards the face and send the signal to the machine to detect the face using OpenCV and displayed the result.
- I tried detecting faces using available pretrained models like YOLO, RESNET-50 and many more, after detecting the face I've cropped out the faces and sent it to my model and it will detect whether mask is present or not.
- Using Arduino I've implemented 360Â° rotated camera and the ML model will detect the faces and displays the result.
